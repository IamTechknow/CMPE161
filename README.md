# CMPE161 Android ports

Porting and implementing CMPE161 assignments to Android OS

## About

CMPE 161 in UC Santa Cruz is "Mobile Sensing and Interaction", a course about iOS programming with a large emphasis of sensor technologies. When I took the course there were four iOS programming assignments and I am redoing them in Android.

The projects were made in Intellij IDEA Ultimate and have a minimum API level of 21 so your phone needs to have Android L (5.0) installed to run these apps

If you taking CMPE 161 in UC Santa Cruz, know that there's no iOS code here, and assignments may change

## Assignment 1

A "simple calculator" that contains a model representation of a calculator

## Assignment 2

Drawing shapes over a camera preview session. The Camera2 API was used to implement the camera preview

## Assignment 3

Controlling a ball influenced by gravity over a camera preview session, a bit of augmented reality

## Assignment 4

Work in progress. I didn't finish this assignment in the class. It's suppose to display an augmented camera view of colonnade structures around you. Your view of the structures changes as you rotate the phone
